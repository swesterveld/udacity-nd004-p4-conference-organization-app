## Task 1: Add Sessions to a Conference
`Session` is implemented as a child of `Conference`, because that will make it
easier to quickly find all sessions of a conference. `Speaker` is implemented as
a separate model, because that will make it easier for re-use and to extend it
with properties. By using a repeatable `KeyProperty` for speakers of a `Session`,
it will be possible to treat it as a many-to-many relationship.

```python
class Session(ndb.Model):
    """Session object
    """
    name            = ndb.StringProperty(required=True)
    highlights      = ndb.StringProperty()
    duration        = ndb.IntegerProperty()
    typeOfSession   = ndb.StringProperty(default='NOT_SPECIFIED')
    date            = ndb.DateProperty()
    startTime       = ndb.TimeProperty()
    speakers        = ndb.KeyProperty(kind='Speaker', repeated=True)

class SessionForm(messages.Message):
    """Outbound form message for Session
    """
    name            = messages.StringField(1)
    highlights      = messages.StringField(2)
    duration        = messages.IntegerField(3)
    typeOfSession   = messages.EnumField('SessionType', 4, default='NOT_SPECIFIED')
    date            = messages.StringField(5)
    startTime       = messages.StringField(6)
    speakers        = messages.StringField(7, repeated=True)
    websafeKey      = messages.StringField(8)


class SessionForms(messages.Message):
    """Outbound form message for multiple Session messages
    """
    items = messages.MessageField(SessionForm, 1, repeated=True)
```

The following endpoint methods have been defined:

- `getConferenceSessions` -- This invokes a generic `_getSessions` method which
  returns a list of existing Sessions of a conference that matches the given
  webSafeConferenceKey.
- `getConferenceSessionsByType` -- This invokes a generic `_getSessions` method
  which returns a limited list of existing Sessions of a conference that matches
  the given webSafeConferenceKey. Because in this case the invokation of the
  generic `_getSessions` method is done with an extra parameter for filtering on
  type, it will limit the list Sessions according to the given type.
- `getSessionsBySpeaker` -- This method returns a list of Sessions accross all
  conferences, limited to the Sessions where the given speaker is in the list of
  speakers.
- `createSession` -- This invokes a `_createSessionObject` method which copies
  the data from the request to a new Session object.

The `_updateSpeakersForSession` method has been implemented as a generic method,
to invoke for both adding and removing Speakers of a Session. Like this, the
endpoints addSpeakerToSession and `removeSpeakerFromSession` can be kept very
clean. Another generic method is _getSessions, with an optional parameter for
filtering. This makes it possible to have very light endpoints for specific
filters, and have the implementation of filtering at one place, according to the
DRY principle.

```python
    def _updateSpeakersForSession(self, request, add):
        """Based on the calling endpoint, add or remove a Speaker.
        """
        session = ndb.Key(urlsafe=request.websafeSessionKey).get()

        [...]

        if add:
            if spkr_key not in session.speakers:
                session.speakers.append(spkr_key)
                session.put()
        else:
            if spkr_key in session.speakers:
                session.speakers.remove(spkr_key)
                session.put()

        return self._copySessionToForm(session)

    @endpoints.method(SESSION_POST_REQUEST_MODIFY_SPEAKERS, SessionForm,
                      http_method='PUT', name='addSpeakerToSession')
    def addSpeakerToSession(self, request):
        """Add a Speaker to a Session.
        """
        return self._updateSpeakersForSession(request, add=True)

    @endpoints.method(SESSION_POST_REQUEST_MODIFY_SPEAKERS, SessionForm,
                      http_method='PUT', name='removeSpeakerFromSession')
    def removeSpeakerFromSession(self, request):
        """Remove a Speaker from a Session.
        """
        return self._updateSpeakersForSession(request, add=False)
```


## Task 2: Add Sessions to User Wishlist

The following endpoint methods have been defined:

- `addSessionToWishlist()` -- adds the session to the user's list of sessions
  they are interested in attending
- `getSessionsInWishlist()` -- query for all the sessions in a conference that
  the user is interested in
- `deleteSessionInWishlist()` -- removes the session from the userâ€™s list of
  sessions they are interested in attending

The endpoint methods for adding and deleting are implemented on a similar way as
the previously mentioned methods for adding and deleting speakers. They invoke
a generic method called `_updateSessionsInWishlist` that will either add or
delete an item to or from the wishlist, based on a boolean-parameter.


## Task 3: Work on indexes and queries

### Come up with 2 additional queries

The following endpoint methods have been defined, with additional queries:

- `getUpcomingConferences` -- query for all conferences that will be
  held in the upcoming 3 months. This can be useful for users who want to check
  for conferences that will be held soon, but haven't attracted their attention
  yet. Or maybe for people who only know on 'short term' if they have time to
  visit a conference. The inner workings of this method are described in the
  next section.
- `getConferencesNotSoldOutInAmsterdam` -- this is a query I would be
  interested in myself, because I'm living in Amsterdam. Visiting a conference
  can take a lot of my precious time, especially when it's a conference abroad.
  And did you ever think about biking from home to the venue in 15 minutes,
  instead of flying for hours? And leaving from home means sleeping at home,
  which is a big plus as well :)

  This is basicly what the code does:
  ```python
      in_amsterdam = Conference.query(
          Conference.city == 'Amsterdam')
      not_sold_out = Conference.query(
          Conference.seatsAvailable > 0)

      confs = self._intersectQueries(in_amsterdam, not_sold_out)
      names = self._getConferenceOrganisers(confs)

      return ConferenceForms(
          items=[self._copyConferenceToForm(
              conf, names[conf.organizerUserId]) for conf in confs])
  ```
  (some of it is described in the next section)

### Query related problem with inequality filtering for multiple properties

According to the [docs][7], the Datastore API doesn't support inequality
filtering on multiple properties:

> Limitations: The Datastore enforces some restrictions on queries. Violating
> these will cause it to raise exceptions. For example, combining too many
> filters, using inequalities for multiple properties, or combining an
> inequality with a sort order on a different property are all currently
> disallowed. Also filters referencing multiple properties sometimes require
> secondary indexes to be configured.

When you try to filter queries on multiple properties, a `TypeError: Model is
not immutable` is raised. There are multiple approaches possible to tackle this
problem, of which I've chosen an implementation that intersects the results of
two queries. This is more or less what my first implementation with an
intersection looked like, to get all upcoming conferences for the next 3 months:

```python
    date_now = datetime.today().date()
    date_end = (date_now + timedelta(3*365/12))

    confs_from = Conference.query(
        Conference.endDate >= date_now)
    confs_till = Conference.query(
        Conference.startDate <= date_end
    )

    intersection = set(
        [c.key.urlsafe() for c in confs_from]) & set(
        [c.key.urlsafe() for c in confs_till])

    result = ndb.get_multi(
        [ndb.Key(urlsafe=item) for item in intersection]
    )
```

When I ran into a similar problem for filtering non-workshop sessions that are
not scheduled after 19:00, I decided to move the intersecting procedure to a
separate generic method:

```python
    def _intersectQueries(self, q1, q2):
        """ Return objects according to an intersection of two queries
        """
        return ndb.get_multi(set(
            q1.fetch(keys_only=True)) & set(
            q2.fetch(keys_only=True))
        )
```

This method can be invoked like this:
```python
    non_workshop = Session.query(
        Session.typeOfSession != 'WORKSHOP')
    before_seven = Session.query(
        Session.startTime < datetime.strptime("19:00", "%H:%M").time())

    sessions = self._intersectQueries(non_workshop,before_seven)
```

Besides the fact that the code has a re-usable component, an other advantage
(at least in my opinion) is easier to read.

For a lot of datasets this solution will work well enough. For really big
datasets a solution with the [MapReduce][8] library would probably give a
better solution. It's a more havyweight approach, yet more scalable.
